# CanvaDot

CanvaDot is a collaborative online canvas where everyone draws together on a single expanding grid. The community funds canvas growth through small contributions, unlocking more space for everyone. From time to time, special art events take place — participation costs as little as €1, and 50% of the prize pool goes directly to the winning artist.
